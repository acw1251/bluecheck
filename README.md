BlueCheck
=========

(NOTE: This version of BlueCheck has been modified from the original
version to support shrinking for modules that may deadlock or trigger
the wedge detector. *This has not been fully tested yet*, but it looks
good so far. -Andy)

(Inspired by the QuickCheck tool for testing Haskell programs.)

BlueCheck is a *generic* test-bench written in the Bluespec HDL.  It
is generic in the sense that it can be used to test *any* design.

To use it, the developer simply provides a specification of
correctness: a set of properties, written in Bluespec, about the
design under test.

BlueCheck then automatically tests these properties, reporting any
counter-examples found.

It's main features are:

  * *Automatic test-sequence generation*, with support for definining
    custom generators when the default one doesn't suffice.

  * *Iterative-deepening*: the lengths of test-sequences are increased
    gradually over time with aim of finding simple failures first.

  * *Shrinking*: once a failing test-sequence is found, BlueCheck tries
    to make it shorter by repeatedly ommitting possibly-unneeded
    elements.  This helps find simple failures quickly.

  * *Fully synthesisable*: it can run on FPGA as well as in simulation,
    allowing thorough testing.  Counter-examples found on FPGA are
    automatically trasferred to a host PC to be viewed or replayed
    in simulation.

  * *Ease of use*: rigourous HDL-level test frameworks can be
    constructed by writing a very small amount of code.

A good place to start learning about BlueCheck is [this

Also, take a look at the examples in
[SimpleExamples.bsv](SimpleExamples.bsv) and
[StackExample.bsv](StackExample.bsv).  These can be built using
[make.sh](make.sh).
